This repo is for the [Maker Advent Calendar - The 12 Projects of Codemas](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h) from [The PiHut](https://thepihut.com/). I'm working through the [daily guides](https://thepihut.com/pages/maker-advent-2022-guides), saving the MicroPython code from each day and making brief notes.

## Day 1 - Getting Started!
Setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico H, installing and configuring Thonny, and writing code to turn the onboard LED on and off.

## Day 2 - Let's Get Blinky!
Basic circuits in the [breadboard](https://wiring.org.co/learning/tutorials/breadboard/). LEDs and their polarity: long leg, anode `+`; short leg, cathode `-`. Resistors and where to use them. Indentation and `while` loops in Python. Creating a circuit with 3 LEDs and 3 resistors, and writing code to turn these LEDs on and off.

## Day 3 - Bashing Buttons!
Adding buttons to circuits, and using pull downs to ensure voltage is low to start with. Conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`) - and toggling values.
