# advent2022

This repo is for the [Maker Advent Calendar - The 12 Projects of Codemas](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h) from [The PiHut](https://thepihut.com/). I'm working through the [daily guides](https://thepihut.com/pages/maker-advent-2022-guides), saving the MicroPython code from each day and making brief notes.

## Day 1 - Getting Started!
Setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico H, installing and configuring Thonny, and writing code to turn the onboard LED on and off.
